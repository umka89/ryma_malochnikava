## Debug Mode

To run Cypress in debug mode, you can use the following command:

`DEBUG=cypress:* npx cypress run`

This command enables debug logs for Cypress, which can help you troubleshoot issues during test execution1.

For more detailed instructions on debugging Cypress tests, you can refer to the [Cypress Debugging Documentation2.](https://docs.cypress.io/app/guides/debugging)

## Headless Mode

To run Cypress in headless mode, you can use the following command:

`npx cypress run --headless`

This command runs your tests without a graphical user interface, which can speed up the testing process3.

For more detailed instructions on running Cypress in headless mode, you can refer to the [Cypress Headless Mode Tutorial3](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/cypress-headless-mode-tutorial).
